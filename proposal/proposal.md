## Tentative Contribution

Due to the nature of being an online class and people having variable schedules hard deadlines will be hard to enforce on any given individual \
by the end of the project though we should expect that each member has given as much to the project as was reasonably expected of them. \
Ultimately everyone will be resposible for approximately 1 task per week and will be delegated at the top of the week and will be revisted at the \
end to ensure that timelines are met and we leave enough room for the role that life plays in ours lives.
